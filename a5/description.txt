There are two bugs in my implementation. The first one gives a segementation fault when the program involves a while. 
I forgot to create a branch for cond_block. I simply add the CreateBr(cond_block) and the segementation fault disappears.

The second bug is in binary expression, My control flow is not correct and the setup of phi node is wrong. 

I first changed the control flow and then I figure out that for the phi node incoming blocks and values, I just 
need to check the second subexpression. Since if the first expression is true (false) for Or (And), the result should 
be fixed and we do not need the value of second expression and we do skip the slow block and go directly to the exit block.
And if the value of expression can't be determinted by the left subexpression, we need to check the right subexpression. 
Therefore, we go slow blocks and evaluate the second subexpression. 
Thus, for the phi node, if we come from the entry block, the value should be "0" for the "And" and "1" for the "Or". Else 
if we come from the slow block, the value should be the value of second subexpression.
