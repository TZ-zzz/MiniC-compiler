For most rules, I just follow the language. For stmt, I notice that my number of stmt is different with the expected number which is because the  left-recursion. I add a stmt_list for the case that number of stmts are greater than or equal to 1 so that the combination of two statements will not form the 3rd statement which satisfies the public test. In the meantime, I found that stmt_list only appears in scope, therefore I replace the stmt_list in the scope with the rule of stmt_list and delete the explict stmt_list rule. And then I did the same thing for the vardecl.

For parameterlist and varlist, I notice that they are left-recursive too. Then I decide to use parameterlistentry and varlistentry which contains the case that there is only one parameter or variable. Then varlist (parameterlist) contains one or more varlistentries (parameterlistentry).

Use the same strategy, I create the declentry which is the rule of single declaration and decl contains one or more declentries.
