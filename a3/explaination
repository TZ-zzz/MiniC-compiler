First, I read the ASTNode classes to get the structure of our AST tree. Then I just need to add complier actions to the rules I written in A2.

For most rules, what we need to do is to initialize the rule and add sub-rule as its child. For some cases, the return values are list, then we need to initialize an empty vector and add no element or one element to it. And for recursion cases, we only need to add the latter element in the end of vector.

For the rules involves vectors we mentioned above, we need to add all elements in the vector as children. Therefore we need to loop over the number of elements which can be done by the std::vector::iterator, and add each element as a child.

For the test, I first ran the public tests and passed all of them. Then I ran the program with private test cases of A2 and see if there were anything wrong.
